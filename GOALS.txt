This file is for things to implement so I don't forget about them

1. nominate command (only music/movie-of-the-week)
  add functionality that only people with the exec role can use this command
  DONE

2. new member join event
  add functionality to send a welcome message in #meet-and-greet whenever a new member joins
  this will replace Discord's default welcome message
  IN PROGRESS

3. adminhelp command (only exec / directors-board channel)
  displays information on the different admin commands available to exec members in the UFS bot
  also come up with admin commands

Jocelyn's baby:
4. emoji react event for kicks
  if a message is kick reacted, increment the number of total kicks for the member who sent the message
    EDGE CASE: make sure to decrement if a member unreacts, otherwise multiple counts can be obtained from the same member
  figure out storage system for this that is unaffected by bot resets (Jocelyn needs help with this part)
  firebase? can double for quote submission, google forms integration, etc (MotW noms?)
  trial run for emoji react event for roles (5.)

6. Add Tony's reviews to the bot at some point, check the pinned message in the testing discord for members to get more reviews in for
  If lack of reviews or more serious / long reviews, feel free to skip
  Remember to look at newcoming member followers for the UFS LB, and add their reviews to the csv if need be

7. Add a pipeline for members to fill a Google Form that will provide us with either a Letterboxd review link (lbquotes), or the name(s), quote, and date (quotes); provide an example on the form for how to fill out the quote
  then, have this be stored in a queue for whoever has access to the bot to see if the quote/review should be added or not to the corresponding csv file in the UFS Bot
